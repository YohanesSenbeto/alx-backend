<h1>Caching Project</h1>
# Overview
<h4>
This project focuses on implementing various caching algorithms in Python. It covers the concepts of caching, different cache replacement policies including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.

Background Context
In this project, you will learn about different caching algorithms and their implementations in Python. The project aims to deepen your understanding of caching systems and their importance in optimizing performance in computer systems.

Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

Explain what a caching system is
Understand the concepts of FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU caching algorithms
Describe the purpose of a caching system
Identify the limitations of caching systems
Resources
To get started with this project, you can read or watch materials on:

Cache replacement policies - FIFO
Cache replacement policies - LIFO
Cache replacement policies - LRU
Cache replacement policies - MRU
Cache replacement policies - LFU
Requirements
Python Scripts
All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
Coding Standards
Your code should use the PEP 8 style guide (version 2.5)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation explaining their purpose
Project Structure
The project consists of the following tasks:

Basic Cache: Implements a basic caching system.
FIFO Cache: Implements a caching system using the FIFO (First In, First Out) replacement policy.
LIFO Cache: Implements a caching system using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) replacement policy.
LRU Cache: Implements a caching system using the LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy.
MRU Cache: Implements a caching system using the MRU (Most Recently Used) replacement policy.
LFU Cache: Implements a caching system using the LFU (Least Frequently Used) replacement policy.
